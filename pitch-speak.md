After this charming demo let's see what is the reality?
The whole game are written in a HTML / JS / JSDoc combination.
Don't contain any framewrok expect a Tailwind CSS.
The compiled code are less than 120Kib.

We are found us on board of Flogon spacehisp. I am afraid  this moment is not a best to tell about the Flogon specis,  who have a uniqe capability to dream travel throught the whole universe. On the library of this ship you will be found a much more detailed information about this little fellow.

I don't would like to fire my every gunpower, but  this peacfull guys found the humans ar so violent,  that will be a problem in a long term.

But now let's talk about this game, which you can try also  on a link, the best way if you install to your mobile phone  because on a full screen can be show the full potential.

Meantime the mother ship ar fly througth the unvierse, and each of room have a different activity.

For example a space navigation practice game, wher you need to be found a spreading marker in space.

But the main attraction is the Flogon pairing game, which is looks easy on a first sight, but a tricky game.  A sort rule is: positive odd number can be pair to positive  even number. Zero can pair any nonzero card. The negative odd number  to another negative odd number, also the negative even number ot another negativ even number. A last special rule is the negative number can pair the positive counterpart.
But this is not the end, because you play 4 card in your front and your "oppontent" the quest is draw two card in every round. But if reach the 4th card, then turn the table and "quest" is paired your card, and gain a score. A big problem is when somehow the quest have a more score than you. In this game have a special yellow button on a left wall. If you click, then whole gameplay
are automatic goning.

Two rooms left of this POC level game. The first is a library powered my small markdown viewer WebComponent. In this room you can read and "watch" a borader information of Flogons.

And finally may I present our brilliant singer: Wora Shard. She was a first human who is ever met a flogons. On her adventurous journey are inspired to write some a brand new Track. You can listen it.
