Dear Pure Web Foundation.

I am fun of your ideas. That is inspired me to dig myself of this topic. I am a pragmatic  developer so I am like to test a different use cases in a real application, which is complex enough to show my ideas are working or not. A few month ago I started on small game challenge at dev.to with a react app, because I would like to test my JSDoc based react state npm module, which is small and working, but that application is non intuitive and don’t contain game animation ( it is a card game ).

After that I turn to a pure web development, where I writing a simple HTML page including a Tailwind CDN, and vanilla JS code. Without any compile that process will be release my framework chains, and I can create a responsive game setup.
I don’t want to write the whole story, but a month later I am able to turn my 2D card game a 3D card game without any outer dependency or game engine.

After that I found a 2 hackhaton on a devit, where I wrote a 2 games. The second one is much like a story of imagenery species on the galaxy who is meet to us.
The whole of program is a PWA application and pure web creation.

here is a detailed blogpost of my game: https://community.aws/content/2rmBlPQhaWEWylZu72H1Vtm8EMe/javascript-great-again-the-voice-of-void
or in the dev.to: https://dev.to/pengeszikra/javascript-great-again-the-voice-of-void-5fp6
