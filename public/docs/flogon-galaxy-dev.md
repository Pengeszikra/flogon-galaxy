# Stuck on previous development
## The real problem is:
I cannot able to moving forward my next gama and I was stack to a
`laderboard` problem on Reddis
_Devvit_

This system us so exiting, even I can implement a real game

A this point I need to make a Quick decision, I try to finish my
previous game with a score board or I moving forward,
with the fancy Flogon Galaxy ?

## Marker is great for organize my tought.
Even I can use it for a `blogpost dev environment`
That is the question.

## MARKER as my `hyperspeed` game development
Because it is capable to combine a different HTML program
and assets as `easy` as possible.

```
// need to be a loader function to a MARKER
// to improve this editor maybe help to achive
// a new hyper speed development process
```

## ZED with vim
Maybe I can switch to ZED, at least I need to know why I keep the work with VSCode.
Good question. The VIM motions seems working, but at this moment I don't ready for
that.

I was remember ZED is fast but don't have a nice auto save option.
