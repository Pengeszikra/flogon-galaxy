My biggest dept is: I don't have to shaping my story about the Flogons to you.
So this chaper at least told a few basic things about Flogons.
Please listen it this discusion about Flogon special dream travel capability and the 
universe undiscovered material the Inverzit.

We don't reach even the closest star system at this moment. But the first contact give a chanche to reach undreamed distances. The main problem because the Flogons are nor technocrat or kapitalist, because the distance and the possible place don't close it, like us. So hard to understund what is the common between us.

So the flogon use a bit different the technic than as, because some of them even cabale to shape change into a item also. Not every flogon can dream travel, also not every flogon capable to that level of shape change - but normal shape chanege is very common. That why sometimes use cloth sometimes not. We don't know yet how many start systems or galaxy they are explored.

But our scientist are collect a strange theory from the Flogon from Wora Shard. This is some hidden code which can be ready any one: Just need to be count a 42 markers  distance ( fluctuation ) in a π. This is:

## Theory of π / 42

A deep dive into the mathematical intrigue behind the Flogon universe, where π and the number 42 hold the key to understanding cosmic resonance. Wora Shard even crated a song about this one.

## Wora Shard
A question worth pondering. The short answer? She was just an underground Punk-Metal singer, lost in the echoes of rebellion—until the night she dreamed herself into the vast unknown.

One moment, she was on Earth. The next, she awakened on a distant, alien world, surrounded by mysteries beyond human comprehension. Stranded and disoriented, she would have been lost forever… if not for Yogdar, a seasoned Flogon captain who saw something unusual in her arrival.

Through perilous journeys across the galaxy, through worlds uncharted and dangers untold, Yogdar guided her back home. But something had changed. Wora was no longer just a singer—she was a traveler between realms, a dreamer who had touched the fabric of a universe she barely understood.

And this… this is where our story truly begins.
