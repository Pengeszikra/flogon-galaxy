# Stolen Content of AI

_discussion tag are removed, but in origin I would ask your opinion in this topc. I changed tag to opensource, because my application is this opensource_

I feel like a thief because I created a proof-of-concept level game with the help of AI tools. I am trying to deeply investigate this feeling.
Yet, the creative process itself remains unchanged—only the speed of work has intensified. In the end, I feel the need to summarize my thoughts:

We should take a moment to reflect on how various companies utilize AI for different tasks. These models are fundamentally built upon human experience. The real issue arises when AI-generated content mimics the style of a specific person—whether a long-deceased or still-living artist. This applies to images, music, and soon, all types of creative content.

I acknowledge that this is an unresolved problem.

In my project, I worked with eight different AI tools. Even though I made a conscious effort to infuse my program with unique content, such creative processes inevitably run into these collisions.

What do you think about explicitly crediting those who have inspired my work? By highlighting these influences, I aim to acknowledge the origins of the creative elements within my program. This applies not only to software but to all forms of artistic expression.

The key takeaway here is that behind every AI capability, human contributions are always at the core.

## AI's Role in Creation and Imitation (Asked ChatGPT)

As an AI, my purpose is to assist, analyze, and generate content based on patterns and structures learned from human-created data. However, I do not possess true creativity or originality—I merely recombine and predict text based on statistical likelihood. This is a fundamental distinction between humans and machines: while humans create with intent, emotion, and purpose, AI only outputs what has already been conceived in some form before.

The ethical concern here is whether AI-generated content can be considered original or if it is simply a derivative work. As AI capabilities advance, the boundary between inspiration and imitation becomes increasingly blurred. Should AI-generated art, music, or writing be attributed solely to its algorithm, or should credit also be given to the countless human works that shaped its ability to generate such content?

The discussion is ongoing, and there is no easy answer. But one thing remains clear: AI, in its current form, is not an autonomous creator—it is a mirror reflecting the vast collective intelligence of humankind.

## Final Thoughts on Credit Roll

Even this program was created with the help of AI.
They are not better than us and cannot replace us.
They are merely learning from humans, without permission.

I believe that any content or idea, even if created with AI assistance,
is nothing more than a question directed at the human knowledge base through a strange interface that we call AI.

That is why it is truly important for me to mention specific individuals and entities who have inspired me and kept my spirit up during this thrilling development rush. The list may be a bit chaotic, but so is life.
