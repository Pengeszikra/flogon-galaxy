I have witnessed the rise of humankind.

At this moment, I cannot see the end of the road.

For decades, we have built a base on the Moon and pushed our frontier to Mars. Slowly, we fought to secure our chance for survival—redirecting one extinction-level asteroid. Yet one barrier remained: deep space travel. We had no way to traverse the vast emptiness of the universe.

Until everything changed.

Because of a single haunted girl.

Her name is Wora Shard, a punk-metal singer. Wild at heart, unlucky in love, and tormented by relentless nightmares. One night, after her worst nightmare yet… she woke up on an alien planet.

Meanwhile, across the universe, someone else also had a nightmare. But he wasn’t human—not even close.

Entor Nimoga, a Flogon elder, had never dreamed of another species capable of Dream Travel. Only Flogons possessed that ability—or so they thought. This discovery sent shockwaves through their kind. The elders gathered. A decision had to be made.

Wora Shard fought to survive. Oxygen, water, life—it was all there, primitive yet sufficient. She adapted, explored, and soon uncovered signs of past intelligence on this world.

The Flogons reached their verdict: rescue her.

Captain Yongdar prepared his ship. A volunteer team assembled. Their mission: to find the lost girl. But Flogon space travel was not what humans imagined. It wasn’t engines or wormholes—it was Dream Travel. A captain could dream an entire starship across the cosmos.

But finding an unknown planet proved difficult, and the journey took two years.

By then, Wora Shard had endured sickness, built a sustainable way to live, and even mapped parts of the planet Gonzo.

And then, finally, the Flogons arrived.

A planet-wide search began. Rescue teams spread across Gonzo. Two months later, they found her.

But now came another challenge: communication.

Fortunately, Flogons learn languages quickly. They brought Wora aboard their mothership: Tiny Spark. This moment marked the first encounter between humanity and another intelligent species.

Once communication became possible, a new mission emerged: returning Wora to Earth.

Yet, how do you describe a single star in the vast universe… when the only witness is a young woman?

This adventurous journey took three more years, during which they met many civilizations and gathered valuable information.

And then, at long last…

Tiny Spark reached the Solar System.

A landing vessel descended toward Wora's city, its approach unnoticed by Earth's space defense systems.

Finally, Wora was home.

But she had made a promise. Some of her Flogon friends would come to her concert—to jam together, to experience human music firsthand. And so, they did.

The concert was electrifying. The masked band played with an otherworldly energy, their instruments resonating in ways never heard before. The crowd was mesmerized—until someone realized the masked musicians weren’t human.

Word spread. Authorities moved in.

The government attempted to seize them, but they were too slow. The Flogons retreated, vanishing into the night and returning to Tiny Spark.

Wora, however, wasn’t so lucky. She was arrested.

My job was to find the truth—I was the lead investigator.

“Ms. Vera Wendotter, please tell me the whole story. I need to understand everything!”

Weeks later, my team drew closer to the truth, but events escalated rapidly. The CIA arrived, and my boss had no choice but to hand authority over to them.

Fortunately, Ulma Khiny, our scientist, resolved the situation with a bold step:

“You’ll find Wora in Section B, below ground level, where we’re studying her dream phases. Swenson, please lead these agents.”

We had five minutes to escape!

We grabbed Wora and ran to the parking zone. Suddenly, a mobile burger van blocked our path.

“Johanson, what the hell?”

“Detective, Ulma, Wora—get in! I'll explain later!”

Johanson was an expert driver. We vanished into the night astonishingly fast. After changing vehicles, we headed to a small northern village. Finally, we had a plan!

“What’s next?”

“I'm afraid my journey continues,” Wora said.

“We must contact the Flogons. I hope they don’t abandon us!”

Ulma figured out how to send a message to the Tiny Spark crew. Captain Yongdar initiated a new mission to rescue us.

We silently watched Earth fade away from the navigation room of an alien spaceship.

I experienced Dream Travel firsthand. At that moment, we were just one jump from Entor Nimoga's planet. He wanted to meet us in the Elders’ Ring to determine if humankind was worthy of connecting with the Flogons.

I knew our only ace was Wora Shard.
