Dear < XYZ >,

Thank you for the inspiration you gave me for my short film https://youtu.be/bQaJraE4s_g. I’m a completely unknown developer tucked away in a remote corner of the internet—just one of your followers. The fact that this “creation” was completed with a fair amount of AI assistance doesn’t mean that some artificial logic was the main driving force behind the creative process. Your inspiration (along with that of many others) awakened the dormant urge inside me and helped bring the project to life.

< XYZ specific part >

The next part is totally skippable, I just want to note how I got here.

It all began when, in November 2024, I found two computer‑game programming contests. Even with the first game I spent far more time on back‑story than on the code itself; that’s when the world of the Flogons was born—though back then they were drawn as funny cartoon characters. Their yet‑unwritten abilities already defined them. In parallel, Wora Shard’s character and first songs also emerged.

By the time of the second game (neither game won its contest) the beginning of the story had taken shape in my head, and Wora already had six tracks to her name.

The emptiness after the contests and the frantic creative pace found a new goal when I discovered the Neuro Masters AI video competition—somehow I can only really work when there’s a challenge. That’s when I decided it was time to tell the beginning of the story, where the big question for me is the possible scenarios of first contact between this alien species and humanity. The unfolding story has held plenty of surprises even for me, and of course this is only the beginning.

Using various AI tools is really just a creative instrument for me, and the process is immeasurably more primitive and full of impossible tasks and challenges—something I wrote an article about. Even so, I have to admit that with so little time and such sparse financial (and personal) resources, I couldn’t have achieved the goal of telling a story at proof‑of‑concept level.

Once again, let me emphasise how much it means to me that I could draw inspiration from your work along the way.
