**Subject:** Thank You for Inspiring My Short Film!

Dear XYZ,

Thank you for inspiring me and keeping my creativity alive during the thrilling process of creating my sci-fi short animation. I've included your name in the credits, and the video is available on my YouTube channel, Pengeszikra. If you'd like a shorter summary of how specifically you inspired me or more details about my project, I'm happy to send you another message.

Thanks again for everything!

Best regards,
