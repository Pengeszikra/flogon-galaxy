Dear XY,

Thank you for the inspiration you gave me for my short film (https://youtu.be/bQaJraE4s_g). I’m a completely unknown developer tucked away in a remote corner of the internet—just one of your followers. The fact that this “creation” was completed with a fair amount of AI assistance doesn’t mean that some artificial logic was the main driving force behind the creative process. Your inspiration (along with that of many others) awakened the dormant urge inside me and helped bring the project to life.

At first glance it may look like “just” an animated sci‑fi short cobbled together from a makeshift idea—or, because a musician appears in it, some kind of space opera. In reality, one thread that led me to write the story was a different physical perspective in astrophysics: what if technology isn’t the solution, but instead there exists a species capable of dream‑travel? Unspoken in the film is the notion that this species—unconsciously, in its sleep—can use quantum symmetry to travel, and even to transport others. The method is unsafe (and has only crystallized into its current form over millennia). Nonetheless, the journey happens in the dreamer’s own time: if someone travels to a planet 4–5 light‑years away, they actually arrive 4–5 years “earlier.” When they return, the time that elapses at point B passes simultaneously at point A as well (except in strong gravitational fields). In principle the whole universe is traversable at once; the only limit is that the farther the destination, the smaller the chance of finding a habitable place. Beyond roughly seven billion light‑years, the odds of encountering life drop dramatically—and not every traveler survives the trip.

My other (slightly conspiracy‑theory‑tinged) astrophysical idea is that in this “world” there is no dark energy or dark matter. Instead there is a group of substances called *inversite*, whose chief property is inverse mass, so gravity acts on them inversely. Inversite is responsible for the effects we normally attribute to dark energy and dark matter. Exploiting it, they can build spacecraft and vehicles with almost zero mass, so landing on or taking off from a planet costs far less energy. The laws of physics still apply to them, and apart from dream‑travel they can move within a star system only by conventional means—nor can they send information faster than light. These unspoken assumptions underpin my story.

And of course I couldn’t resist turning a properly pseudoscientific premise into a song: from the spacing (resonance) of the 42s among the digits of π they extract some vital information. That became this track: https://youtu.be/nSjjrrqZbvQ

Sorry for the length of this letter; I listen to the *Atomcsill* series with great pleasure. The next part is totally skippable—I just want to note how I got here.

It all began when, in November 2024, I found two computer‑game programming contests. Even with the first game I spent far more time on back‑story than on the code itself; that’s when the world of the Flogons was born—though back then they were drawn as funny cartoon characters. Their yet‑unwritten abilities already defined them. In parallel, Wora Shard’s character and first songs also emerged.

By the time of the second game (neither game won its contest) the beginning of the story had taken shape in my head, and Wora already had six tracks to her name.

The emptiness after the contests and the frantic creative pace found a new goal when I discovered the Neuro Masters AI video competition—somehow I can only really work when there’s a challenge. That’s when I decided it was time to tell the beginning of the story, where the big question for me is the possible scenarios of first contact between this alien species and humanity. The unfolding story has held plenty of surprises even for me, and of course this is only the beginning.

Using various AI tools is really just a creative instrument for me, and the process is immeasurably more primitive and full of impossible tasks and challenges—something I wrote an article about. Even so, I have to admit that with so little time and such sparse financial (and personal) resources, I couldn’t have achieved the goal of telling a story at proof‑of‑concept level.

Once again, let me emphasise how much it means to me that I could draw inspiration from your work along the way.
