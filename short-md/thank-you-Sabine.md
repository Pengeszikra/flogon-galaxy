Dear Sabine,

Thank you for the inspiration you gave me for my short film  https://youtu.be/bQaJraE4s_g. I’m a completely unknown developer tucked away in a remote corner of the internet—just one of your followers. The fact that this “creation” was completed with a fair amount of AI assistance doesn’t mean that some artificial logic was the main driving force behind the creative process. Your inspiration (along with that of many others) awakened the dormant urge inside me and helped bring the project to life.

As uneducated developer please light me to play a theory of how can reach the civilization in a cosmos instead of some technology. I watch a lot of your videos and bright me many details of physics and other scientic topic as well. I wish: keep your works in that spirit.

It may look as if this is “just” an animated sci‑fi short story thrown together on a whim—or, because a musician shows up in it, maybe some sort of space‑opera. In reality, one of the threads that led me to write the story was a different take on astrophysics:

What if technology isn’t the key at all, but instead there exists a species capable of dream‑travel? Unspoken in the tale is the idea that, while asleep, this species can (unconsciously) use quantum symmetry to travel—and even carry others with them. The method is risky (it only crystallized into its “modern” form over millennia). Crucially, the journey occurs in the dreamer’s timeframe: if someone travels to another planet four or five light‑years away, they effectively arrive there four or five years earlier than “now.” And when they return, the time that passes at point A is the same that passed at point B (except in strong‑gravity situations).

So the whole universe is traversable at once; the only limit is that the farther the destination, the lower the chance of landing somewhere inhabited. Beyond roughly seven billion light‑years, the odds of finding life drop off sharply—and not every traveler survives the trip.

My other (admittedly conspiracy‑theory‑ish) astrophysical twist is that this universe contains no dark energy or dark matter. Instead there’s a class of substances called inversit, characterized by inverse mass, which means gravity acts on them in the opposite way. The phenomena we attribute to dark energy and dark matter are really caused by inversit. Using it, they can build spacecraft and vehicles with virtually zero mass, so landing on or leaving a planet costs them far less energy. Otherwise, the standard physical laws still apply: beyond dream‑travel they can only move around a star system by conventional means, and they can’t transmit information faster than light. Those are the unspoken fundamentals behind my story.

And of course I couldn’t resist turning a truly pseudoscientific notion into a song: they derive some crucial message from the spacing (the “resonance”) of all the 42s in the digits of π. The result is this track:  https://youtu.be/nSjjrrqZbvQ

The next part is totally skippable, I just want to note how I got here.

It all began when, in November 2024, I found two computer‑game programming contests. Even with the first game I spent far more time on back‑story than on the code itself; that’s when the world of the Flogons was born—though back then they were drawn as funny cartoon characters. Their yet‑unwritten abilities already defined them. In parallel, Wora Shard’s character and first songs also emerged.

By the time of the second game (neither game won its contest) the beginning of the story had taken shape in my head, and Wora already had six tracks to her name.

The emptiness after the contests and the frantic creative pace found a new goal when I discovered the Neuro Masters AI video competition—somehow I can only really work when there’s a challenge. That’s when I decided it was time to tell the beginning of the story, where the big question for me is the possible scenarios of first contact between this alien species and humanity. The unfolding story has held plenty of surprises even for me, and of course this is only the beginning.

Using various AI tools is really just a creative instrument for me, and the process is immeasurably more primitive and full of impossible tasks and challenges—something I wrote an article about. Even so, I have to admit that with so little time and such sparse financial (and personal) resources, I couldn’t have achieved the goal of telling a story at proof‑of‑concept level.

Once again, let me emphasise how much it means to me that I could draw inspiration from your work along the way.
