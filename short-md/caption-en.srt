1
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:12,551
I am witness to the rise of humankind.

2
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,878
The end remain unssen.

3
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:17,775
For decades, we built a base on the Moon

4
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:19,372
and pushed our frontier to Mars.

5
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:22,361
Slowly, we fought to secure our chance for survival

6
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:24,989
Redirecting one extinction-level asteroid.

7
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:28,342
Yet one barrier remained: deep space travel.

8
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:31,771
We had no way to traverse the vast emptiness of the universe.

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,244
Until everything changed.

10
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,309
Because of a single haunted girl.

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,286
Her name is Wora Shard, a punk-metal singer.

12
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,477
Wild at heart, unlucky in love,

13
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:44,396
and tormented by nightmares.

14
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:11,000
One night, after her worst nightmare yet…

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:45,000
she woke up on an alien planet.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Meanwhile, across the universe,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:45,000
someone else also had a nightmare.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But he wasn’t human—not even close,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Entor Nimoga, a Flogon elder,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:00:45,000
had never dreamed of another species capable of Dream Travel,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Only Flogons possessed that ability

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or so they thought,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This discovery sent shockwaves through their kind.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The elders gathered, A decision had to be made.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wora Shard fought to survive,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oxygen, water, life—it was all there, primitive yet sufficient.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She adapted, explored,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and soon uncovered signs of past intelligence on this world.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Flogons reached their verdict: rescue her.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Captain Yongdar prepared his ship,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A volunteer team assembled.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Their mission: to find the lost girl.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But Flogon space travel was not what humans imagined.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It wasn’t engines or wormholes

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it was Dream Travel.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A captain could dream an entire starship across the cosmos,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But finding an unknown planet prove50difficult,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the journey took two years.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
By then, Wora Shard had endured sickness,

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
built a sustainable way to live,

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and even mapped parts of the planet Gonzo.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And then, finally, the Flogons arrived.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A planet-wide search began.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Rescue teams spread across Gonzo.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Two months later, they found her.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But now came another challenge: communication.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Fortunately, Flogons learn languages quickly.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They brought Wora aboard their mothership: Tiny Spark.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This moment marked the first encounter

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:01:00,000
between humanity and another intelligent species.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Once communication became possible, a new mission emerged:

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:01:00,000
returning Wora to Earth,

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yet, how do you describe a single star in the vast universe…

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:01:00,000
when the only witness is a young woman?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This adventurous journey took three more years,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:01:00,000
during which they met many civilizations

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and gathered valuable information.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And then, at long last…

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tiny Spark reached the Solar System.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A landing vessel descended toward Wora's city,

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
its approach unnoticed by Earth's space defense systems.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Finally, Wora was home.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But she had made a promise.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Some of her Flogon friends would come to her concert

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to jam together...

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:01:00,000
..the crowd was mesmerized

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:01:00,000
until someone realized the masked musicians weren’t human.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Word spread, Authorities moved in.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The government attempted to seize them,

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but they were too slow, The Flogons retreated,

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:01:00,000
vanishing into the night and returning to Tiny Spark.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wora, however, wasn’t so lucky.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:01:00,000
She was arrested.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My job was to find the truth.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was the lead investigator.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Ms, Vera Wendotter, please tell me the whole story!"

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"I need to understand everything!"

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Weeks later, my team drew closer to the truth,

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but events escalated rapidly.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The CIA arrived!

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And my boss had no choice but to hand authority over to them.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Fortunately, Ulma Khiny, our scientist,

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
resolved the situation with a bold step:

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“You’ll find Wora in Section B, below ground level,"

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"where we’re studying her dream phases,"

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"Swenson, please lead these agents!”

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We had five minutes to escape!

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We grabbed Wora and ran to the parking zone.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Suddenly, a mobile burger van blocked our path!

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“Johanson, what the hell?”

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“Detective, Ulma, Wora—get in!"

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"I'll explain later!”

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Johanson was an expert driver,

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we vanished into the night astonishingly fast.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:01:00,000
After changing vehicles,

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we headed to a small northern village.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Finally, we had a plan!

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“What’s next?”

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“I'm afraid my journey continues,”

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:01:00,000
“We must contact the Flogons,"

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"I hope they don’t abandon us!”

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ulma figured out how to send a message to the Tiny Spark crew.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Captain Yongdar initiated a new mission to rescue us.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We silently watched Earth fade away from the navigation room of an alien spaceship.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I experienced Dream Travel firsthand.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
At that moment,

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we were just one jump from Entor Nimoga's planet.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He wanted to meet us in the Elders’ Ring to determine

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
if humankind was worthy of connecting with the Flogons,

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I knew our only ace was Wora Shard,
