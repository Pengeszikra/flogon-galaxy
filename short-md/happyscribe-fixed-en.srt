1
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:12,551
I am witness to the rise of humankind.

2
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,878
The end remain unssen.

3
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:17,775
For decades, we built a base on the Moon

4
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:19,372
and pushed our frontier to Mars.

5
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:22,361
Slowly, we fought to secure our chance for survival

6
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:24,989
Redirecting one extinction-level asteroid.

7
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:28,342
Yet one barrier remained: deep space travel.

8
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:31,771
We had no way to traverse the vast emptiness of the universe.

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,244
Until everything changed.

10
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,309
Because of a single haunted girl.

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,286
Her name is Wora Shard, a punk-metal singer.

12
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,477
Wild at heart, unlucky in love,

13
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:44,396
and tormented by nightmares.

14
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:53,999
One night, after her worst nightmare yet…

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,999
she woke up on an alien planet.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,999
Meanwhile, across the universe,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,999
someone else also had a nightmare.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,999
But he wasn’t human—not even close,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,999
Entor Nimoga, a Flogon elder,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,999
had never dreamed of another species capable of Dream Travel,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,999
Only Flogons possessed that ability

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,999
or so they thought

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,999
This discovery sent shockwaves through their kind.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,999
The elders gathered, A decision had to be made.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,999
Wora Shard fought to survive,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,999
Oxygen, water, life—it was all there, primitive yet sufficient.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,999
She adapted, explored,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,999
and soon uncovered signs of past intelligence on this world.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,999
The Flogons reached their verdict: rescue her.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,999
Captain Yongdar prepared his ship,

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,999
A volunteer team assembled.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,999
Their mission: to find the lost girl.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,999
But Flogon space travel was not what humans imagined.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,999
It wasn’t engines or wormholes

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,999
it was Dream Travel.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,999
A captain could dream an entire starship across the cosmos,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,999
But finding an unknown planet prove50difficult,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,999
and the journey took two years.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,999
By then, Wora Shard had endured sickness,

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,999
built a sustainable way to live,

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,999
and even mapped parts of the planet Gonzo.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,999
And then, finally, the Flogons arrived.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,999
A planet-wide search began.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,999
Rescue teams spread across Gonzo.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,999
Two months later, they found her.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,999
But now came another challenge: communication.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,999
Fortunately, Flogons learn languages quickly.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,999
They brought Wora aboard their mothership: Tiny Spark.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,999
This moment marked the first encounter

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,999
between humanity and another intelligent species.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,999
Once communication became possible, a new mission emerged:

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,999
returning Wora to Earth,

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,999
Yet, how do you describe a single star in the vast universe…

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,999
when the only witness is a young woman?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,999
This adventurous journey took three more years,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,999
during which they met many civilizations

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,999
and gathered valuable information.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,999
And then, at long last…

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,999
Tiny Spark reached the Solar System.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,999
A landing vessel descended toward Wora's city,

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,999
its approach unnoticed by Earth's space defense systems.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,999
Finally, Wora was home.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,999
But she had made a promise.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,999
Some of her Flogon friends would come to her concert

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to jam together...

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,999
..the crowd was mesmerized

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,999
until someone realized the masked musicians weren’t human.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,999
Word spread, Authorities moved in.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,999
The government attempted to seize them,

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,999
but they were too slow, The Flogons retreated,

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,999
vanishing into the night and returning to Tiny Spark.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,999
Wora, however, wasn’t so lucky.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,999
She was arrested.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,999
My job was to find the truth.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,999
I was the lead investigator.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,999
"Ms, Vera Wendotter, please tell me the whole story!"

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,999
"I need to understand everything!"

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,999
Weeks later, my team drew closer to the truth,

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,999
but events escalated rapidly.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,999
The CIA arrived!

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,999
And my boss had no choice but to hand authority over to them.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,999
Fortunately, Ulma Khiny, our scientist,

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,999
resolved the situation with a bold step:

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,999
“You’ll find Wora in Section B, below ground level,"

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,999
"where we’re studying her dream phases,"

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,999
"Swenson, please lead these agents!”

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,999
We had five minutes to escape!

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,999
We grabbed Wora and ran to the parking zone.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,999
Suddenly, a mobile burger van blocked our path!

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,999
“Johanson, what the hell?”

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,999
“Detective, Ulma, Wora—get in!"

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,999
"I'll explain later!”

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,999
Johanson was an expert driver,

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,999
we vanished into the night astonishingly fast.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,999
After changing vehicles,

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,999
we headed to a small northern village.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,999
Finally, we had a plan!

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,999
“What’s next?”

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,999
“I'm afraid my journey continues,”

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,999
“We must contact the Flogons,"

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,999
"I hope they don’t abandon us!”

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,999
Ulma figured out how to send a message to the Tiny Spark crew.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,999
Captain Yongdar initiated a new mission to rescue us.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,999
We silently watched Earth fade away from the navigation room of an alien spaceship.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,999
I experienced Dream Travel firsthand.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,999
At that moment,

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,999
we were just one jump from Entor Nimoga's planet.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,999
He wanted to meet us in the Elders’ Ring to determine

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,999
if humankind was worthy of connecting with the Flogons,

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I knew our only ace was Wora Shard,
