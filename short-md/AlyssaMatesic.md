Dear Alyssa!

I would like to ask your help, because I found your advices is very helpful.
As a hobby I created a AI generated short sci-fi film ( 6:41 ).
If you have a time to check it the stroy and character and so on, because I
am hungarian and my english skill is not really high and I don't get any 
reflection of my story is worth to start working on a better version.
For example I feel the final conversation at the end is a bit weak. 

You found the video in my linkedin page, or my youtube channel, where 
you found my protagonist first album also. So the whole creation process
is very new for me, because all is started with a computer game, where 
I would like to answer a few astro physic question, and possibilities of
communicate a different galactic species by beat the light speed limit.
