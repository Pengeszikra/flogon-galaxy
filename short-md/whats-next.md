# What Next
after failure of Neuro Masters version?

## Possible AI competition:

[ReplayAI Film Festival]

## Better Short Description:

I seek the answers:
- What it could be if we reach the technical barrier of space traveling?
- Maybe the Bible was right and God bless our dreams.
- Maybe God is truly All Mighty but a different way than we thinks.
- What if our physical and astro measurements lead us a wrong way?
- Somehow possible the connection between the different universal civilization?
- Maybe other civilization was broke the chain of single solar system, and those step are lead to a peacefull way of live?

## Improvements:

- Rework the whole movie
- Better, simple name: Flogon
- New Intro
- Recast scenes
- Rework the narration
- Maybe using some better video editor
- Short version of Flogon Galaxy: found & run
- Downloadable Wora Shard songs with images
- Midjourney v7 omnireference short video
- new Instagram with Proton Mail -> don't work

## Glitch List

- Initial screen sucks, maybe we can show Tiny Spark before narrator
- Moon and mars scene too static
- Deflect Asteroid scene maybe need for reworkű
- Second Wora clip may rework
- Nightmare rework
- First view of Flogons
- Flogon Elders
- First Wora survive scene
- Volunteer team assambled
- Yongdar dream
- 2nd Wora map planet Gonozo more dynamic
- Search Wora and communication on board rework.
- Landing to earht better animation
- Wora Concert with Flogons
- Goverment animation
- Wora arrest animation
- Fix Johanson scene
- Running out to parking animation
- On fare north to the end rework
- remove video marks

So near the whole movie will be reworked.

Summary:
  - Dynamic scenes
  - Consistent Wora Shard
  - Pulished Concert
  - Consistent Flogons

Long story short:
Sci-fi short film an interstellar odyssey exploring the boundless possibilities of dream-driven quantum travel. Including a question what if the alien race is not so violent as we are, because they don't need to be boundary a single solar system.

.... boring long .... :

This story started as game projcet for hackaton. Flogon first look is a cute
drawing, a few video also found on my channel. Paralelly the main character:
Wora Shard started as a AI singer. I try make a universe where I got answer for a few question: What if in the universe have technical limit: the speed of light, and the wormhole traveling or the hyper speed drive did not exsist. I think the only option the spirit orgaized quantum travelling. If only at least one race have this possibilities then those are capable to work as glue in this universe.

Back to Wora. She have a 13 track, which at least I like to hear under driving. But those inspired by this qdyssey, or her previous life. I hope this solution give a deeper character creation.

After games are maded, I found Neuromasters AI competition, so that why I try to create the untold background story in AI video form. In that time I decide to push the flogons into a real form. A first step is make the narration and put visuals together with iMovie. This is a first sketch: https://youtu.be/2ICGTnt4X_E

When the due date is closing I was a bit of rush, I created the majority of clips in the last 48h before submitted.

AI:
This is the AI tool list, also found at the end of video as AI Crew.
The main help is the ChatGPT, because I am Hungarian and my english skill is uneducated that why I using mainly for translation. Even I wrote two Wora Shard lyric in hungarian ( Tomorrow, Travelers ) and those are translation. Other lyric is generated by different AI, mainly chatGPT but I also try the DeepSeek ( Mirror ).

Now this project a bit of utdated ( means AI video making growing insanly fast ) but more important is under the creation I was using Midjourney 6.1 which is fare more worst on consistent alien character. Now I working on the recasting the story based on Midjourney 7 new Omni reference. Someone also inform me the narration voice is terrible ( I don't have skill to decide between good and bad english narration ), so I will try to rework with elevenlabs instead of revoicer. Plus the story goes on ...


Midjourney:  visual
HailuoAI:  clip
KlingAI: clip, lyps sync
Sora: clip
Suno:  music, voice
Revoicer:  voice over
ChatGPT: project assistant, lyric, translation
HitPaw:  enchant video quality
DreamAI: image creation prompt training

non AI software:
iMovie, Krita



Long story short:
A sci-fi short film—an interstellar odyssey exploring the boundless possibilities of dream-driven quantum travel. It asks: what if an alien race isn’t as violent as we are, simply because they don’t need to be confined to a single solar system?

…Boring long version:
This story began as a game project for a hackathon. Flogon’s first appearance is a cute drawing (and you can find a few videos on my channel). Meanwhile, the main character, Wora Shard, started out as an AI singer. I wanted to build a universe that answers a few questions: what if the only universal speed limit is the speed of light, and wormhole travel or hyperspeed drives don’t exist? I believe the only alternative is spirit-organized quantum travel. If even one race possesses this ability, they could serve as the “glue” holding the universe together.

Back to Wora: she has a 13-track album that I especially enjoy listening to while driving. Each track is inspired either by this odyssey or by her imagined past life. I hope this approach gives her character more depth.

After the game was finished, I discovered the Neuromasters AI competition—so I decided to tell Wora’s untold backstory as an AI-generated video. I pushed the flogons toward a tangible form by writing the narration and pairing it with visuals in iMovie. Here’s the first sketch: https://youtu.be/2ICGTnt4X_E

With the deadline looming, I was in a rush and produced most of the clips in the 48 hours before submission.

AI tools used (listed as “AI Crew” at the end of the video):

ChatGPT (my main aid—since I’m Hungarian and my English needs polishing, I used it heavily for translation). I even wrote two Wora Shard lyrics in Hungarian (“Tomorrow,” “Travelers”) and then translated them.
DeepSeek (“Mirror”) for additional lyric generation.

When I created this project, I was using Midjourney 6.1—which struggled to keep an alien character consistent. Now I’m reworking the story using Midjourney 7’s new Omni reference. I’ve also been told the narration voice sounds terrible (I don’t have the ear to judge English narration), so I’ll redo it with ElevenLabs instead of Revoicer. And of course, the story continues to evolve…
