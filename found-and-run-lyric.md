# Flogon Galaxy: found & run

I witness humankind’s rise. The end remains unseen.

For decades, we have built a base on the Moon and pushed our frontier to Mars. Slowly, we’ve fought to secure a chance for survival—redirecting one extinction-level asteroid. Yet, one barrier remained: deep space travel. We had no way to traverse the vast emptiness of the universe.

Until everything changed.

Because of a single haunted girl.

Her name is Wora Shard, a punk-metal singer. Wild at heart, unlucky in love, and tormented by relentless nightmares. One night, after her worst nightmare yet… she woke up on an alien planet.

Meanwhile, across the universe, someone else also had a nightmare. But he wasn’t human. Not even close.

Entor Nimoga, a Flogon elder, had never dreamed of another species who is capable of Dream Travel. Only Flogons possessed that ability. Or so they thought. This discovery sent shockwaves through their kind. The elders gathered. A decision had to be made.

Wora Shard fought to survive. Oxygen, water, life—it was there, primitive yet enough. She adapted, explored, and soon uncovered signs of past intelligence on this world.

The Flogons reached their verdict: Rescue her.

Captain Yongdar prepared his ship. A volunteer team assembled. Their mission: to find the lost girl. But Flogon space travel was not what humans imagined. It wasn’t engines or wormholes—it was Dream Travel. A captain could dream an entire starship across the cosmos.

But hard to find a unkown planet so that journey took two years.

By then, Wora Shard had endured sickness, built a sustainable way to live, and even mapped parts of the planet Gonzo.

And then, finally, the Flogons arrived.

A planet-wide search began. Rescue teams spread across Gonzo. Two months later, they found her.

But now came another challenge: communication.

Fortunately, Flogons learn languages fast. They brought Wora aboard their mothership: Tiny Spark. This moment marked the first encounter between human and another intelligent species.

Once communication became possible, a new mission emerged: returning Wora to Earth.

Yet, how do you describe a single star in the vast universe… when the only witness is a young woman?

This adventureous journey took three more years and meet many civilization to gather a valuable information.

And then, once upon a time…

Tiny Spark reached the Solar System.

A landing vessel descended toward Wora's city, its approach unnoticed by Earth's space defense systems.

Finally, Wora was home.

But she had made a promise. Some of her Flogon friends would come to her concert—to jam together, to experience human music firsthand. And so, they did.

The concert was electrifying. The masked band played with an otherworldly energy, their instruments resonating in ways never heard before. The crowd was mesmerized—until someone realized the masked musicians weren’t human.

Word spread. Authorities moved in.

The government attempted to seize them, but they were too slow. The Flogons retreated, vanishing into the night and returning to Tiny Spark.

Wora, however, wasn’t so lucky. She was arrested.

My job was to find the truth, I am the lead of investigation team.

- Ms Vera Wendotter please tell me the whole story, I need to me understund everything!

A weaks later my teams get closer to the truth, but events going a real fast, because CIA arrived, and my boss don't have option, give authority to them.

At least Ulma Khiny my scientist solve a situation with a crazy step:

- You will find Wora on the B section under level, where we are inspecting her dream phase, Swenson please lead this agents.

We have a 5 min advance to escape!

Grab Wora with us and run to the parking zone. But then suddenly stopping us a mobile burger van.

- Johanson, what a hell?

- Detective, Ulma, Wora let it in, lateley I will explain everything!

Johanson seems a well skilled drived, we are dissappear to night a surprising fast. After a car changing we going to a small village of north. At last we make a plan!

- What is the next?

- I afraid my journey are continue.

- We need to communicate with Flogons, I hope don't leave us alone!

Ulma figure out how can we send message to the Tiny Sparks crew. Yongdar start a new mission to grab us to startship board.

We was silently watching the Earth as fading away, on a alien ship navigation room.

The I first hand to feel how going the dream travel. At this moment is just one jump to the Entor Nimoga planet. He would like to speak with us on the elders ring to figure out can the humankind worth to connect the flogons.

I know our single ace in our deck is the Wora Shard.
