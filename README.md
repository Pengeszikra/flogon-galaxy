## PROJECT STORY

## Inspiration
My first motivation is a technical related. I am hated to use too much unneccecary dependency.
That why I maded this program from by vanilla JS/HTML/JSDoc. Without any framework expect a Tailwind CSS.
The second path is my inner creativty are boosted by a different AI including the Amazon Q. So in this perspective I feel myself as a team leader, and can my dream driving me to build something unique.
I don't want to forget to thx to all people who is inspred me in this works. Maybe I will finish the credit page at the end of program.

## What it does
It is does a multiple things at once. It is a game, it is a new JSX lib with a Proxy signal which can be almost as effective as a React based setup does but meanwhile I have feel to lost my chains.
Also does as a developer environment, because it is contain a markdown-view WebComponent, and editor.  Which is thx for the DynamoDB is ultra lightweight, but very effective help the whole development process. Plus also  created a simple but really fine
sprite editor also.

## How we built it
I using a Story Driven Development process, which is means at first the visuals, and the
a world of Flogons storylines are created. The main game design are focusing a simple
but challenging card game, which have a great potential to able a drive a next upcomming
release, because this is not the end, instead a begining.
On technical perspective the markdown editor is written a really oldschool HTML page where the JS script are included, and don't need to any compile to run it. But a good reason, if  I would like to use this program to a greater audience, then of course need a minimal
pnpm vite build setup. Instead of TS I using JSDoc which is know almost as the TS,
but don't have too much drawback.

## Challenges we ran into
At a certain point I feel the classic queryselector is not enough fast for a development , and
I get out of my draw a old forgotten JS framework and push a life to it ( we talking of a 150 LOC code ), to capable to handle a JSX, which is speed up the whole development process.
With the midjourney I created a lot of images, sometimes that is too much and hard ot
keep that rithm with a development. But the JS is a wibe based languages and I ride on
a creative flow.

## What we learned
I event can't imaginede how many new things I learned under this amazing journey of
development, including I never worked with DynamoDB.

## What's next for Flogon Galaxy: first contact
At this state tha main part of their story is untold. So I think this path will push me forward.
I also have a plane to make a really fast and lightweight markdown first code editor.
You can test it if you build my code.
